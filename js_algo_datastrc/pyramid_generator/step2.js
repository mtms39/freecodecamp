/*
 * Variable naming follows specific rules: names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.
 * Mutation is characteristic of non primitives data types, such as an array. It means it is mutable, can be changed, when otherwise, primitive data types can only be reassigned
 * A method is a funciton that is associated with certian variables and values
 * array.push() => add value to the end of the array
 * array.pop() => removes the last element from the array
